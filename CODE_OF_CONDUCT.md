# Contributor Code of Conduct for Bot-Verse

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of **Bot-Verse**, pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Guidelines

1. **Reporting Violations**: 
   - If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers. All reports will be treated confidentially.
   - Provide as much detail as possible in your report, including the nature of the incident, any relevant context, and the individuals involved.

2. **Investigating Reports**:
   - Project maintainers will review all reports of unacceptable behavior promptly. 
   - An investigation may include interviewing the involved parties and any witnesses to understand the situation better.

3. **Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior**:
   - After the investigation, maintainers will determine the appropriate response based on the severity of the behavior and the context of the situation. 
   - Possible actions may include:
     - A warning to the individual involved.
     - Temporary or permanent removal from the projectâ€™s community spaces (e.g., chat rooms, forums).
     - Revocation of access to project repositories.
     - Other actions deemed necessary to ensure a safe environment for the community.

4. **Right to Appeal**:
   - Individuals who have been subject to disciplinary action have the right to appeal the decision. Appeals should be made in writing to the project maintainers, outlining the reasons for the appeal. 
   - The appeal will be reviewed by a different set of maintainers if possible, and a final decision will be communicated within a reasonable time frame.

5. **Confidentiality**:
   - All reports and investigations will be conducted in a confidential manner. The identities of individuals involved will be protected to the extent possible, and discussions about the situation will be limited to those directly involved in the investigation.

6. **No Retaliation**:
   - Participants who report or assist in the investigation of misconduct will not face retaliation. Retaliation against anyone who reports a violation is itself a violation of this Code of Conduct and will be addressed accordingly.
